# CS546-FinalProject

Proposal

This proposal will list the group members, give a brief description of your project idea, and all features it will include. Using a GitHub repo is required, and the URL MUST be supplied in your proposal. • Submit two feature sections: core (you must implement) and extra (implement if you have time)

Members:
-Julio Lora
-Markell Tores
-Veronica Abramson
-Alejandro Brancale

Description:
In this multi-week project, we are looking to create a complete planner-based calendar with assignable tasks and collaborative features. Users will be able to create a secure login, navigate a user-friendly UI, create different types of tasks and collaborate/assign them to other web users.

Core Features:
*Note: User sign up and login, cannot be listed as a core feature nor can any of the project requirements. 
*Be careful with what you put in here because if it is not implemented we will get points off

-Implement a clean calendar/planner UI
-Allow for creation of different tasks and events in a well organized manner
-Allow to share tasks and invite other users to events via email or username provided for login purposes


Extra Features (implement if time persists):

-Users may create a customizable profile page for a “social media” aspect
    -Users may upload a profile picture
    -Users may have a bio 
    -Users may add “friends” or “followers”
    -Users may upload blog posts and share interesting content in the form of posts
-Implement a comment feature for other users to provide feedback on different events/tasks they were invited to
-Implement a chat or personal messaging feature between users
-Create an interactive map in which users can post events at certain locations for other users to be able to see
    -Perhaps using a Google Maps API
