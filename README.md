To use our project:
- At the top, you will be able to see our navigation bar. It has the dashboard page, trending page, reviews page, login, and a search at the top right.
- The search bar can be used to search for any platforms, usernames and genres.
- When first opening the page, you will first be brought to our Dashboard. This is a browsing page which displays the artworks for all of the games that are in our databse.
- From the dashboard, you will be able to click on any of the artworks. This will lead you to a detailed page of each individual game. Here you will see the game name, artwork, a description, genre and any platforms this game could be played on. On this page you will also be able to click and "favorite" any game. These games will then be displayed under the "profile" tab.
- The next tab displayed on the nav bar will be the "Trending" page. Each user has the ability to post a review and have other users like/dislike it. The Trending page displays the top 3 most liked reviews in the database.
- The next tab is the "Reviews" tab. When clicking on this, you will see all of the reviews displayed in our database.
- Another tab on the nav bar is "Login". This will prompt you to a Login form with a username and password. For demo purposes, we have created a dummy account with the username "helloKitty" and the password "cat". Once typed in and pressed "Submit" your console will log a "Logged in successfully" message.
- Once done succefully, you can now navigate back to the "Reviews" page and click on the "Post Review" button. This will lead you to a input form which will allow you to post a review to our database.
- The nav bar should also now display a "Profile" page. This page will display the user's username, bio and favorited games.
- Finally, the nav bar displays a "Logout" button. Once logged out, the user will be able to sign in again.
